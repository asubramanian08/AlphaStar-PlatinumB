High Five
The cows on Farmer John’s field have just finished a tiring day of work in the barn, and are now preparing to head home. There are $N$ pastures ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5)$ on the field, along with $N-1$ roads connecting them. Every pasture can reach all the other pastures via a series of roads. The $N$ cows are currently in the barn, located next to pasture $1$.
Each of the cows has a home pasture $p_i$ ($1 \leq p_i \leq N$). They travel from the barn to their home pasture, one at a time. First cow $1$ goes to pasture $p_1$, then cow $2$ goes to pasture $p_2$, and so on.
When cow $i$ walks to their home pasture, they might bump into another cow who is already in their home pasture. If this happens, the cows will each raise one of their hooves and high five each other! Farmer John gets excited whenever the cows do this, so he would like to know how many times this happens for each cow.
Please help FJ determine, for each cow, how many times that cow will high five other cows during her trip to her home pasture.
As an example, consider the following field, where the number in parentheses denotes the cow who has that home pasture.
        1 (3)
       / \
  (1) 4   3 (5)

(2) 2   5 (4)
First, cow 1 walks to her home pasture.
        1 (3)
       / \
  [1] 4*  3 (5)
     / \
(2) 2   5 (4)
Then, cow 2 walks to her home pasture. She high fives cow 1 (in pasture 4) on the way there.
        1 (3)
       / \
  [1] 4*  3 (5)
     / \
[2] 2*  5 (4)
Cow 3 walks to her home pasture, which doesn’t take long; her pasture is right next to the barn (pasture 1).
        1* [3]
       / \
  [1] 4*  3 (5)
     / \
[2] 2*  5 (4)
Cow 4 high fives cows at pastures 1 and 4 on her way to pasture 5.
        1* [3]
       / \
  [1] 4*  3 (5)
     / \
[2] 2*  5* [4]
Cow 5 high fives cow 3 (in pasture 1) on her way to pasture 3.
        1* [3]
       / \
  [1] 4*  3* [5]
     / \
[2] 2*  5* [4]
INPUT FORMAT
The first line of input contains a single integer $N$. The next $N-1$ lines each contain two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$, describing a road connecting pastures $a_i$ and $b_i$.
The next $N$ lines of input each contain a single integer $p_i$. The $i$-th line describes the home pasture of cow $i$.
OUTPUT FORMAT
Output $N$ lines, where line $i$ contains the number of times cow $i$ will high five another cow.
