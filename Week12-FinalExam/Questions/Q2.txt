Cow Parentheses 
Farmer John has just received a new edition of the Moo York Times. The magazine has recently featured a new puzzle known as the Cow Parentheses. In this puzzle there is a tree of $N$ nodes ($1 \leq N \leq 40\,000$), conveniently numbered $1 \dots N$, connected by $N-1$ edges. Each node is labelled with either an opened or a closed parenthesis. 
Between every pair of nodes there is a unique path, and these paths represent strings. The challenge of the puzzle is to determine, among all possible paths that represent correct parentheses sequences, the maximum depth of any sequence. 
Correct parenthesis sequences and their depths are defined below:
An empty string is a correct parenthesis sequence with depth $0$
If "s" is a correct parenthesis sequence with depth d, then "(s)" is a correct parenthesis sequence with depth d+1
If "s" and "t" are both correct parenthesis sequences, then the concatenation "st" is a correct bracket sequence with depth equal to the maximum depth of s and t
Help Farmer John solve this puzzle!
INPUT FORMAT
Line 1: The single integer N
Lines 2..N: Line $i+1$ contains the single integer $x$, indicating that there is an edge between nodes $i$ and $x$ in the tree
Lines N+1..N*2: Line $N+i$ contains a character, either '(' or ')', indicating the label on node $i$
OUTPUT FORMAT
A single integer, indicating the greatest depth of any correct parenthesis sequence along any path of the tree.

The path from node A to node B is the string ((())), which has depth 3
3
. This is the maximum depth of any correct parenthesis sequence represented by a path in the tree.
