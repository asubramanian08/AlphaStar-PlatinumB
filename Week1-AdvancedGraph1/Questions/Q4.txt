Switch Grass
============
[Memory: 256 MB CPU: 2 sec]

Farmer John has recently been experimenting with cultivating
different types of grass on his farm, realizing that different
types of cows like different types of grass. However, he must be
careful to ensure that different types of grass are planted
sufficiently far away from each-other, in order to prevent them
from being inextricably mixed.

FJ's farm consists of N fields (1 <= N <= 200,000), where M pairs
of fields are connected by bi-directional pathways
(1 <= M <= 200,000). Using these pathways, it is possible to walk
from any field to any other field. Each pathway has an integer
length in the range 1...1,000,000. Any pair of fields will be
linked by at most one direct pathway.

In each field, FJ initially plants one of K types of grass
(1 <= K <= N). Over time, however, he might decide to switch the
grass in some field to a different type. He calls this an
"update" operation. He might perform several updates over the
course of time, which are all cumulative in nature.

After each update, FJ would like to know the length of the
shortest path between two fields having different grass types.
That is, among all pairs of fields having different grass types,
he wants to know which two are closest. Ideally, this number is
large, so he can prevent grass of one type from mixing with
grass of another type. It is guaranteed that the farm will
always have at least two fields with different grass types.

In 30 percent of the input cases, each field will be directly
connected to at most 10 pathways.

PROBLEM NAME: grass

INPUT FORMAT:

The first line of input contains four integers, N, M, K, and Q,
where Q is the number of updates (1 <= Q <= 200,000). The next M
lines describe the paths; each one contains three integers A, B,
and L, indicating a path from field A to field B (both integers
in the range 1...N) of length L. The next line indicates the
initial type of grass growing in each field (N integers in the
range 1...K). Finally, the last Q lines each describe an update,
specified by two integers A and B, where the grass in field A is
to be updated to type B.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

For each update, print the length of the shortest path between
two fields with different types of grass, after the update is
applied.
