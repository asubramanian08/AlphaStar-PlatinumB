Time To Go

Farmer John’s 𝑁 cows (1≤𝑁≤10^5) have just attended an amazing party hosted by the one and only
Bessie! There are exactly 𝑁−1 pairs of cows that are friends with each other, and every cow knows
every other cow through some chain of friendships.

The party was fun, but midnight is almost here, so it is time to go. However, the 𝑁 cows are having
too much fun to leave right away, so some cows express their anger by saying that other cows have to
leave before they will. There are 𝑀 (1≤𝑀≤10^5) pairs of cows (𝑎𝑖,𝑏𝑖) such that cow 𝑎𝑖 must leave
before cow 𝑏𝑖. Note that cows 𝑎𝑖 and 𝑏𝑖 may or may not be friends.

In addition, cows don’t want to be left with no one to hang out with at the party, so they want to
leave in some order such that as long as there are two or more cows left, every remaining cow has a
remaining friend.

Each of the cows would really like some alone time with Bessie, so each cow 𝑖 wants to know if there
is a valid ordering where cow 𝑖 is the last cow to leave. Please help the cows determine this
information. It may be that there is no way for the cows to leave satisfying the given constraints.

INPUT FORMAT

The first line of input contains two integers 𝑁 and 𝑀.
The next 𝑁−1 lines each contain two integers 𝑥𝑖 and 𝑦𝑖 (1≤𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑖≤𝑁, 𝑥𝑖≠𝑦𝑖), indicating that cows 𝑥𝑖 and 𝑦𝑖
are friends.
The next 𝑀 lines each contain two integers 𝑎𝑖 and 𝑏𝑖 (1≤𝑎𝑖,𝑏𝑖≤𝑁, 𝑎𝑖≠𝑏𝑖), indicating that cow 𝑎𝑖 must leave
the party before cow 𝑏𝑖.

OUTPUT FORMAT

Output 𝑁 lines. The 𝑖th line should contain a 1 if cow 𝑖 could be the last to leave, or a 0 otherwise.
