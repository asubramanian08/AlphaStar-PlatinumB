Why Did the Cow Cross the Road III
==================================
[Memory: 128 MB CPU: 2 sec]

Farmer John is continuing to ponder the issue of cows crossing
the road through his farm, introduced in the preceding two
problems. He realizes now that the threshold for friendliness is
a bit more subtle than he previously considered -- breeds a and
b are now friendly if |a-b|<=K, and unfriendly otherwise.

Given the orderings of fields on either side of the road through
FJ's farm, please count the number of unfriendly crossing pairs
of breeds, where a crossing pair of breeds is defined as in the
preceding problems.

PROBLEM NAME: friendcross

INPUT FORMAT:

The first line of input contains N (1 <= N <= 100,000) and K
(0 <= K < N). The next N lines describe the order, by breed ID, of
fields on one side of the road; each breed ID is an integer in
the range 1...N. The last N lines describe the order, by breed
ID, of the fields on the other side of the road. Each breed ID
appears exactly once in each ordering.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Please output the number of unfriendly crossing pairs of breeds.

SAMPLE INPUT:

4 1
4
3
2
1
1
4
2
3

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2

In this example, breeds 1 and 4 are unfriendly and crossing, as
are breeds 1 and 3.
