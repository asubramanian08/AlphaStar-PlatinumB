Delegation

[Memory: 16 MB CPU: 2 sec]

Farmer John's farm consists of N pastures (2 <= N <= 10^5)
connected by N−1 roads, so that any pasture is reachable from
any other pasture. That is, the farm is a tree. But after 28
years of dealing with the tricky algorithmic problems that
inevitably arise from trees, FJ has decided that a farm in the
shape of a tree is just too complex. He believes that
algorithmic problems are simpler on paths.

Thus, his plan is to partition the set of roads into several
paths and delegate responsibility for these path among his
worthy farm hands. He doesn't care about the number of paths.
However, he wants to make sure that these paths are all as large
as possible, so that no farm hand can get away with
asymptotically inefficient algorithms!

Help Farmer John determine the largest positive integer K such
that the roads can be partitioned into paths of length at least
K.

SCORING:

* In test cases 2-4 the tree forms a star; at most one vertex has
degree greater than two.

* Test cases 5-8 satisfy N <= 10^3.

* Test cases 9-15 satisfy no additional constraints..

PROBLEM NAME: deleg

INPUT FORMAT:

The first line contains a single integer N.

The next N−1 lines each contain two space-separated integers a
and b describing an edge between vertices a and b. Both a and b
are in the range 1...N.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Print K.
