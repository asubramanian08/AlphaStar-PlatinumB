Circular Barn
=============
[Memory: 32 MB CPU: 2 sec]

Being a fan of contemporary architecture, Farmer John has built
a new barn in the shape of a perfect circle. Inside, the barn
consists of a ring of n rooms, numbered clockwise from 1...n
around the perimeter of the barn (3 <= n <= 1,000). Each room has
doors to its two neighboring rooms, and also a door opening to
the exterior of the barn.

Farmer John wants exactly ri cows to end up in room i
(1 <= ri <= 1,000,000). To herd the cows into the barn in an orderly
fashion, he plans to unlock k exterior doors (1 <= k <= 7), allowing
the cows to enter through only those doors. Each cow then walks
clockwise through the rooms until she reaches a suitable
destination. Farmer John wants to unlock the exterior doors that
will cause his cows to collectively walk a minimum total amount
of distance after entering the barn (they can initially line up
however they like outside the k unlocked doors; this does not
contribute to the total distance in question). Please determine
the minimum total distance his cows will need to walk, if he
chooses the best k such doors to unlock.

PROBLEM NAME: cbarn

INPUT FORMAT:

The first line of input contains n and k. Each of the remaining
n lines contain r1...rn.
